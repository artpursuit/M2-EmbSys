# OBSTACLE DETECTION IN VEHICLES

# Block Diagram 

# ULTRASONIC SENSOR:
•	It sends Ultrasonic Pulse through air and if any obstacles found the pulse hits and return back.
•	By calculating the time taken to return the distance is measured

# MICROCONTROLLER:
•	Single Chip Microcontroller in AVR Family.
# Driver:
•	Interface between controller and motor.
•	It takes low current control signal into higher current  control signal that can drive a motor.

# DC MOTOR:
•	Converts electric energy in mechanical energy.
