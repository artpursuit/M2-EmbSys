# INTRODUCTION
A line follower robot is a robot which follows a certain path controlled by a feed back mechanism.

# SWOT ANALYSIS

# REQUIREMENTS

o	High Level Requirements.

o	Low Level Requirements.

# High Level Requirements:

|High Level Requirements|	Description|
|---|---|
|HLR1	|There shall be Sensor to sense path.|
|HLR2	|	Microcontroller shall control our Embedded system.|
|HLR3	|There shall be a Motor driver to control Motor.|
|HLR4	|There shall be a actuator.|

# Low Level Requirements:

|Low Level Requirements|	Description|
|--|--|
|LLR1	|Ir sensor shall sense the path and directs the robot to move in the correct path.|
|LLR2|	Atmega 328 shall receive signal from IR sensor and controls motor driver.|
|LLR3|	Motor driver shall control the motors to move either left,right or forward.|
|LLR4	|Dc motor shall act as a actuator.|

	The above block diagram is of Line Follower Robot. 	
# COMPONENT DESCRIPTION
# IR SENSOR:
	Electronic Device.

	Emits light to Sense objects.

	Senses Radiation which are invisible to eyes.

	Emitter is IR Led.

	Detector is IR Photo diode.

# Atmega 328 Microcontroller:
	ATmega328 is an 8-bit, 28-Pin AVR Microcontroller.

	Follows RISC Architecture. 

	Flash-type program memory of 32KB.

	2-16 bit timers.

# Motor Driver:
	Capable of running two motors .

	Direction of two motors can be controlled independently

# DC Motor:
	These are small motors .

	Needs low current.

	Acts as a actuator.

# APPLICATIONS

•	Industrial Applications: These robots can be used as automated equipment carriers in industries replacing traditional conveyer belts.

•	Automobile applications: These robots can also be used as  automatic running on roads with embedded magnets.

•	Domestic applications: These can also be used at homes for domestic purposes like floor cleaning etc.

•	Guidance applications: These can be used in public places like shopping malls, museums etc to provide path guidance.
