# Block Diagram 

# Water Level sensor:
•	By controlling resistance, a potentiometer can determine how much current flows through a circuit

# Water Flow Sensor:
•	water flows through the rotor and rotor rolls. 
•	speed changes with different rate of flow. 
•	The hall-effect sensor outputs the corresponding pulse signal.

# Rain Sensor:
•	This sensor is a resistive dipole.
•	Based on the moisture  it shows the resistance.
•	It shows more resistance when it is dry and shows less resistance when it is wet
# Microcontroller:  
•	PIC microcontroller
•	High performace RISC cpu.
•	Very Fast.
•	Power consumption less.
•	Easy programming.
# Esp 8266:
•	Low cost micro wifi chip.
•	RISC processor.
# Driver:
•	Used to control another circuit or component.
# Relay:
•	Electrically operated Switch.
•	Controlls valve.
